"Notes","Please note, we do not report 2020 American Community Survey 1-year estimates.

Previously, CCC calculated the employment population ratio for the working age population (aged 16 to 64). In December 2019, CCC adjusted this indicator to measure the employment population ratio of the civilian population aged 16 and older, in line with reporting from the&nbsp;<a href=""https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000"" target=""_blank"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>."
